# GOVUK.UK Prototype Kit Wireframe Plugin
A plugin for the GOV.UK Prototype kit that reduces the fidelity of the prototype. Inspired by the styling of the Balsamiq Wireframe application this will turn your prototype into a low-fidelity wireframe.

## Installing the plugin
To install the plugin follow the Prototype Kit [install and use plugins page](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/install-and-use-plugins)

## Styling choices

### Fonts
The plugin uses two fonts from Google Fonts, [Balsamiq Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Balsamiq+Sans) and [Flow Circular](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Flow+Circular). The Balsamiq Sans is the hardwritten font created for the Balsamiq Wireframes. The Flow Circular is a font family built for abstracting content and code for design mockups, wireframing, presentations, and websites. If you want to hide content then add the class name `.govuk-block` and the font will switch from Balsamiq Sans to Flow Circular.
